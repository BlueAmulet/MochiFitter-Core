# Unofficial MochiFitter Enhancement Project

This repository hosts an unofficial derivative of the **MochiFitter / もちふぃった~** project created by **Nine Gates**. It is based on the publicly released GPLv3-licensed core and is provided entirely without affiliation, approval, or endorsement from the original creator.

## Usage

In your Unity project, locate the `BlenderTools\blender-4.0.2-windows-x64\dev` folder and replace the retarget_script2.py with the one from this repository, making sure to match the original name of the script.  
This folder is located outside of the Assets folder. You can get to it from ALCOM/VCC by clicking the three dots next to your project, and clicking "Open Project Directory."  
To revert back to the original script, delete and let **MochiFitter** redownload the script.

## Overview

This project focuses on two primary areas:

1. **Performance Enhancements**  
   Various optimizations to speed up outfit conversion, while maintaining compatibility with the original MochiFitter Project.

2. **English Translation**  
   An English translation based on ChatGPT, DeepL, and community support, with tooling to automatically apply translations to newer versions of the core.

All modifications are incremental changes to the upstream GPLv3 code and maintain compatibility with the licensing requirements of the original project.

Contributions and issue reports are welcome.
